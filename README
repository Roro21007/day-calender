# Day Calender

## Description
My goal for this project was to better my understanding of javascript along with the new subject of APIs. This assignment is a mixture of many of our previous subjects in small doses along with new topics. 

## Usage

This day calender stores all typed tasks in local storage, keeping tasks on document until close. Color changes on calender according to time of day.API provides date and running time to determine these things.
